# React Guidelines

## REACT_ROUTER

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation

## REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

## REACT_QUERY

- Use TanStack Query (formerly React Query) with appropriate staleTime and gcTime based on data freshness requirements
- Implement the useInfiniteQuery hook for pagination and infinite scrolling
- Use optimistic updates for mutations to make the UI feel more responsive
- Leverage queryClient.setQueryDefaults to establish consistent settings for query categories
- Use suspense mode with <Suspense> boundaries for a more declarative data fetching approach
- Implement retry logic with custom backoff algorithms for transient network issues
- Use the select option to transform and extract specific data from query results
- Implement mutations with onMutate, onError, and onSettled for robust error handling
- Use Query Keys structuring pattern ([entity, params]) for better organization and automatic refetching
- Implement query invalidation strategies to keep data fresh after mutations

## Anti-patterns

### React Anti-patterns to Avoid

- Never use "use client" directive (Next.js specific - not needed with Astro)
- Avoid prop drilling - use context or state management instead
- Don't mutate state directly - always use setState or state updater functions
- Avoid inline function definitions in JSX for frequently rendered components
- Don't forget dependency arrays in useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback
- Avoid using index as key in lists unless items are static and have no IDs
- Don't create new object/array references in render without memoization
- Avoid excessive re-renders by not creating new objects/functions in render
